abstract: Radiomic features have demonstrated encouraging results for non-invasive detection of molecular biomarkers, but the lack of guidelines for pre-processing MRI-data has led to poor generalizability. Here, we assessed the influence of different MRI-intensity normalization techniques on the performance of radiomics-based models for predicting molecular glioma subtypes.
